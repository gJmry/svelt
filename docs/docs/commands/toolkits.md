# Toolkits

When initializing your Svelte project using the `svelte init` command, you have the option to add a **Toolkit**. 🚀

## 🎨 Available UI Toolkits

### **1. Tailwind 🛠️**
A utility-first CSS framework designed for rapid UI development. Tailwind provides an extensive set of pre-defined utility classes, enabling you to style your application directly in your markup without writing custom CSS.

### **2. Flowbite 🧩**
A UI kit built on top of Tailwind CSS, offering ready-to-use components like buttons, modals, and navigation bars. Flowbite enhances productivity by combining Tailwind's utility-first approach with pre-designed elements.

## 🔮 Future Updates

At present, only **2 toolkits** are available for integration during initialization. However, more toolkits will be added in the future to provide even greater choice for your projects. 🌱

✨ **Stay tuned** for updates as the toolkit options expand! 🎉
